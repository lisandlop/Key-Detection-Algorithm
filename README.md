# Key Detection Algorithm
Algorithm that detects the key of a song. 
Coded in Python, using Google Colab. 
 
The algorithm takes in chosen song, analyzes and processes the audio signal, and detects the key of the song from the processed data. 

Coded by me in Python using NumPy and SciPy (2019). 
Algorithm built in a Music Informatics course.
